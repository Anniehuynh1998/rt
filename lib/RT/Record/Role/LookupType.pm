=head1 NAME

RT::Record::Role::LookupType - Common methods for records which have a LookupType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Certain records, like custom fields, can be applied to different types of
records (tickets, transactions, groups, users, etc). This role implements
such I<LookupType> concerns.

This role does not manage concerns relating to specifying which records
of a class (as in L<RT::ObjectCustomField>).

=head1 REQUIRES

=head2 L<RT::Record::Role>

=head2 LookupType

A C<LookupType> method which returns this record's lookup type is required.
Currently unenforced at compile-time due to poor interactions with
L<DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record/AUTOLOAD>.  You'll hit run-time errors if
this method isn't available in consuming classes, however.

=cut

with 'RT::Record::Role';

=head1 PROVIDES

=head2 RegisterLookupType LOOKUPTYPE FRIENDLYNAME

Tell RT that a certain object accepts records of this role via a lookup
type and provide a friendly name for them.

Examples:

    'RT::Queue-RT::Ticket'                 => "Tickets",                # loc
    'RT::Queue-RT::Ticket-RT::Transaction' => "Ticket Transactions",    # loc
    'RT::User'                             => "Users",                  # loc
    'RT::Group'                            => "Groups",                 # loc
    'RT::Queue'                            => "Queues",                 # loc

This is a class method.

=cut

my %REGISTRY = ();

sub RegisterLookupType {
    my $class = shift;
    my $path = shift;
    my $friendly_name = shift;

    die "RegisterLookupType is a class method" if blessed($class);

    $REGISTRY{$class}{$path} = $friendly_name;
}

=head2 LookupTypes

Returns an array of LookupTypes available for this record or class

=cut

sub LookupTypes {
    my $self = shift;
    my $class = blessed($self) || $self;
    return sort keys %{ $REGISTRY{ $class } };
}

=head2 FriendlyLookupType

Returns a localized description of the LookupType of this record

=cut

sub FriendlyLookupType {
    my $self = shift;
    my $lookup = shift || $self->LookupType;

    my $class = blessed($self) || $self;

    return ($self->loc( $REGISTRY{$class}{$lookup} ))
        if defined $REGISTRY{$class}{$lookup};

    my @types = map { s/^RT::// ? $self->loc($_) : $_ }
      grep { defined and length }
      split( /-/, $lookup )
      or return;

    state $LocStrings = [
        "[_1] objects",            # loc
        "[_1]'s [_2] objects",        # loc
        "[_1]'s [_2]'s [_3] objects",   # loc
    ];
    return ( $self->loc( $LocStrings->[$#types], @types ) );
}

=head1 RecordClassFromLookupType

Returns the type of Object referred to by ObjectCustomFields' ObjectId column.
(The first part of the LookupType, e.g. the C<RT::Queue> of
C<RT::Queue-RT::Ticket-RT::Transaction>)

Optionally takes a LookupType to use instead of using the value on the loaded
record.  In this case, the method may be called on the class instead of an
object.

=cut

sub RecordClassFromLookupType {
    my $self = shift;
    my $type = shift || $self->LookupType;

                blessed($self) . " #". $self->id
                ." has incorrect LookupType '$type'"
            );

        }
        return undef;
    }
    return $class;
}

=head1 ObjectTypeFromLookupType

Returns the ObjectType for this record. (The last part of the LookupType,
e.g. the C<RT::Transaction> of C<RT::Queue-RT::Ticket-RT::Transaction>)

Optionally takes a LookupType to use instead of using the value on the loaded
record.  In this case, the method may be called on the class instead of an
object.

=cut

sub ObjectTypeFromLookupType {
    my $self = shift;

        return undef;
    }
    return $collection_class;
}

=head1 IsOnlyGlobal

Certain record types (users, groups) should only be added globally;
codify that set here for reference.

=cut

sub IsOnlyGlobal {
    my $self = shift;

    return ($self->LookupType =~ /^RT::(?:Group|User)/io);
